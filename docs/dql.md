Qlearning is a reinforcement learning method suitable for problems with discrete state space and input (action) space problems. It has been extended to problemswith continuous state space () and then to problems with continuous input state ().

###Q learning:

`Q-Learning attempts to learn the value of being in a given state, and taking a specific action there.`
